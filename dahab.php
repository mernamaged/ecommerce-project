            <h1 class="hh">Dahab</h1>
            <p class="hp" > Dahab is a small Egyptian town on the southeast coast of the Sinai Peninsula in Egypt <br>
                Formerly a Bedouin fishing village, Dahab is now considered to be one of Egypt's most treasured diving destinations<br>
                The word Dahab is Arabic for gold and is possibly a reference to the geographic locality<br>
                gold washed down from the desert mountains may have accumulated on the alluvial flood plain where the town was built<br>
                The name may also be a reference to the colour of the sands to the south of the town itself<br>
                Some locals attribute the name to the colour of the sky just after sunset.</p>

                The Blue Hole is a diving location on the southeast 
                The Blue Hole is a submarine sinkhole, with a maximum depth within the hole of just over 100 m 
                The Blue Hole is popular for freediving because of the depth directly accessible from shore and the lack of current.

                The colored canyon is a labyrinth formed from sandy rocks full of colors, as a result of torrential rain and rain in the winter between the mountains, and this is the main reason for the formation of the colorful canyon.

                <h1>The caves</h1>
                The Caves ares about 15 km south of Dahab and marks the last dive we can do in the south before the road gets blocked and camels take over to Gabr El Bint (highly recommended dive).
                The Caves has got a special entry as we can jump into the water to find a big sandy slope starting at 3 meters and going down to 30 meters.  
                Many stonefish and scorpionfish are found at this site, along with brightly coloured sea slugs – keep an eye on the sandy bottom.

                <h1>THE MOUNT SINAI SUNRISE HIKE</h1>
                Hiking Mount Sinai is often the number one most recommended activity in Dahab.
                This mountain, located in the Saint Catherine region of the Sinai Desert is almost universally accepted as being the biblical Mount Sinai. This is the place where Moses was said to have received the ten commandments from god.

                <h1>SCUBA DIVING  </h1>
                Did you know that the Red Sea is one of the best dive destinations on earth? This unique region is well known for its healthy coral reefs, abundant marine life, and insane visibility!
                Therefore, you’re correct to assume that one of the best things to do in Dahab is to go scuba diving or snorkeling! The Dahab promenade is lined with dive centers where qualified scuba divers can dive at famous shore dives the Blue Hole, Ras Abu Galum, the Canyon, 3 Pools, and the Caves.

                <h1>THE BLUE LAGOON</h1>
                This is a crystal clear sheltered lagoon located just a short distance north of Dahab. The water color here is one of the most tranquil shades of blue I’ve ever witnessed, making it a great place to swim and enjoy the serenity. Also, it’s a great spot to watch professional kite surfers right from the shore!
                However, getting here requires a bit of an adventure. Read my guide (linked above) for more information on how to get here.
