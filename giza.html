            <p>Giza is an Egyptian city on the west bank of the Nile, near Cairo. The Giza Plateau is home<br>
            to iconic Egyptian monuments, including 3 tall pyramids built as royal mausoleums around the 26th<br>
            century B.C. The largest, the Great Pyramid, is King Khufu’s tomb. The Great Sphinx is a vast sculpture<br>
            of a man’s head on a lion’s body. The Solar Boat Museum displays a restored cedar barge found buried near the Great Pyramid.
